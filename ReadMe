		compile_16S.R - remove host contamination, cluster OTUs, assign taxonomy of 16S seqs (DECIPHER) [3]
		remove_controls_ITS2.Rmd - code that removes contamination and controls from ITS2 phyloseq object [4*]
		denoise_ITS2.R - remove erroneous OTUs from ITS2 seqs (DADA2) [2]
		example analysis_ITS2.R - code for PCoA and perMANOVA for ITS2 phyloseq object [5*]
		compile_ITS2.R - remove host contamination, cluster OTUs, assign taxonomy of ITS2 seqs (DECIPHER, ITSx) [3]
		compile_ITS1.R - remove host contamination, cluster OTUs, assign taxonomy of ITS1 seqs (DECIPHER, ITSx) [3]
		denoise_ITS1.R - remove erroneous OTUs from ITS1 seqs [2]
		denoise_16S.R remove erroneous OTUs from 16S seqs [2]
		trim.sh - shell script with programs Cutadapt and Seqpurge to remove primers and adaptors from the sequences [1]
		pheniqs.config.json - custom demultiplexing json file (did not work so used CGRB demultiplexing)
	data 
		meta - sample metadata
			LeRoy_litter_metadata_3-14-22.csv - updated litter metadata
			litterbot.csv - old metadata that included Scotts's 'bot' samples
		Ptri_genome - P.trichocarpa genome files (not using because we need Salix genome, but probably fine to omit)
		raw - undemultiplexed reads for custom demultiplexing (we used CGRB demultiplexing instead)
		taxonomy_db - SILVA and UNITE databases to assign bacterial and fungal taxonomy
	output
		trim - output from trim.sh
		phy_ITS2 - ITS2 phyloseq object
		phy_ITS1 - ITS1 phyloseq object
		phy_16S - 16S phyloseq objectd
		figs - figs from code
		demux - demultiplexed reads 
		dada - output from denoise files
		compile - scratch files for ITS1, ITS2, and 16S

[#] order that code is run
*only for ITS2 sequences. Need to adapt code for ITS1 and 16S.
